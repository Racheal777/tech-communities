# Tech Communities You Can Join

A growing list of tech communities and event hubs to help you connect, volunteer, or get support—especially if you’re just starting out.

## Why This Repo Exists

So many people miss out on events or communities simply because they never heard about them.  
Let’s change that—together.

## How to Contribute

You can add it by submitting a Pull Request or sharing it in the Discussions tab.

There are no strict rules—just be kind, and make sure it’s active or useful.
